# Library-Management-System
Constructed a relational database for Library Management and designed tables including: Publisher, Book, Borrower, LibraryBranch, Book_Copies, Book_Loans, and Book_Authors.

Integrated data from 7 Excel files and structured it into a normalized schema using MySQL.

Wrote complex SQL queries to retrieve insights on book availability, borrower activity, loan history, and author specific data.

Applied joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions to solve real-world scenarios like tracking due dates, unavailable books, and borrower behavior.
